\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}


\usepackage{graphicx}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are

% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\IEEEPARstart{A}{} cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is a relic radiation from the big bang. We can measure this radiation today as an oldest light from the universe. One of the fundamental questions in cosmology is the existence of cosmic inflation just after the beginning of the universe, and the theory of inflation predicts the existence of the curl pattern, called B-mode, in the CMB polarization pattern if the inflation exists. The world-wide effort to hunt this signal is in progress from the ground, balloon, and space-borne telescopes, and the corresponding instrumental development is ongoing. One of the key instruments is called polarization modulator, which consists of a half-wave plate that rotates at a few Hz at the cryogenic temperature. Due to the faint signal, the half-wave plate (HWP) has to be maintained below about 10~K in order to minimize its own thermal emission. As a result, this system requires to achieve the continuous rotation at the cryogenic temperature. The standard mechanical bearing dissipates too much heat and  thus it is important to employ the rotational mechanism that allows to rotate with minimal heat dissipation. A superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB) is a contactless bearing, and thus it achieves a continuous rotation at cryogenic temperature environment with minimal energy loss from friction. This technology is particularly attractive for various applications, including flywheel energy storages and high efficiency motor bearings. A polarization modulator for a cosmic microwave background polarization experiment is one of the applications which the SMB can play a key role to enable the continuous rotation at below 10 K environment. 

We constructed the prototype rotational mechanism using an SMB that operates at 10~K. 
The rotor magnet has to be held in place in order to achieve the field cooling. 
Thus, we develop a holder mechanism. 

In this paper we have conducted the two types of mesurements that are essential to understand for thermal ***. 
First, we have conducted the spin down measurements with an SMB diametere of **.
From this measurement, we have estimated the upper limit of the energy loss from the SMB. 

Secondly, we have estimated the thermal conductance between the rotor and the stator when the rotor is held by the holder mechanism. 
We also measure to estimate the levitating rotor temperature using this holder mechanism.

\section{Thermal conductance through the holder mechanism}
The prototype SMB system is constructed. 
The detailed description of this prototype system is in Matsumura et al.~\cite{}. 
The entire system is enclosed in a GM cryostat and cooled down to the lowest temperature of about 6~K.

The cooling sequence is following. 
The rotor magnet is held by the three grippers when the SMB is cooled from the room temperature to the temperature of about 6~K. 
The YBCO is field-cooled by the magnetic field of the rotor. 
Once the rotor is thermalized by the conduction through the three gripper arms, the rotor is released and it levitates. 

\subsection{Thermal conductivity of the holder mechanism}
The thermal conductance between the stator and the rotor during the cool down process is purely limited by the physical contact of the holder mechanism. 
The three grippers are placed in 120 degrees apart as shown in Figure~\ref{}. 
The gripper has a wedge shape that moves radially and mate with the rotor that also has an identical edge shape. 
The gripper is actuated by a cryogenic stepping motor. 
We mounted the temperature sensor on the gripper arm and the rotor. 
We also placed three heaters, thin-film resistors, on the rotor.
The thermal conductance via wires for the thermometers and heaters are estimated as less than 3~$\mu$W.
We measure the temperature difference between the rotor and the gripper warm.
Figure~\ref{} shows the linear relationship between the applied electrical heat and the temperature difference between the rotor and the gripper arm.
We derive the Kapitza resistance of two metal surfaces at the interface from the slope.
The corresponding resistance is $10^{3}$~K\/W, and the corresponding effective thermal conductance is $1$~mW\/K.
The surfaces of the gripper and the rotor are not polished nor gold plated. 
While we can increase the pressure between the two surfaces by applying more torque on the rotor we did not pursue this in order to mitigate the actuator to be stacked by applying too much torque.

%The three thin-film resistors (heater) and the three temperature sensor (Cernox) are mounted on the rotor. The resistive power is applied when the rotor magnet is held by the three grippers and we estimate the thermal conductance through the physical contact of the holder mechanism. 
%Once the rotor is levitating, the rotor temperature is difficult to estimate. We develop the calibration scheme to estimate the rotor temperature by using a thermometer mounted at the gripper arm.

\section{Estimation of the rotor temperature}
When the rotor is levitating, it is difficult to estimate its temperature remotely. 
We conduct the experiment to estimate the rotor temperature by monitoring the temperature on the gripper arm at the moment of holding the rotor. 
The sequence of the experiment is following. 
The three gripper holds the rotor until the rotor is themalized. 
Once the rotor is thermalized, the rotor is released and thus the rotor levitates. 
We apply the electrical power to the rotor heater.
The rotor temperature increases due to the no thermal pass except the radiation and resistive wires. 
Once the temperature of the rotor increases to about 10~K, we grip the rotor using the three grippers. 
We monitor the temperature rise of the three temperature sensors mounted on each gripper arm. 
Figure~\ref{} shows the temperature profile as a function of time. 

The gripper temperature spikes up when the gripper makes a contact to the rotor. 
The rotor temperature starts decreasing together with the gripper temperature once the gripper temperature reaches to maximum.
We fit the gripper temperature data with two functional forms, linear and exponential. 
When the temperature difference between the stator and the levitating rotor is small, the exponential form fits well. 
On the other hand, the temperature difference is large, the linear function fit better. 
For the linear fit, we select that gripper temperature data between $(T_g^{max}+T_g^{min})/2$ and $T_g^{max}$, where $T_g^{max}$ and $T_g^{min}$ are the maximum and the minimum temperature in this profile.
The extrapolated temperature from the fit at the time of the gripping shows the lower temperature than the actual rotor temperature by less than 2~K.
