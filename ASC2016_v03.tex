% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
We present the thermal characteristics of a superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB) system that is designed for a polarization modulator of a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment.
The SMB system consists of the ring shape magnet and an array of YBCO tiles. Both have the opening diameter of about 400~mm.
The ring shape magnet is formed by an array of segmented magnets.
The magnetic field inhomogeneity of this rotor magnet is originated from the magnetic field inhomogeneity of each magnet and the spatial gap between the segments.
This inhomogeneity can contribute as a source of friction, and thus a source of heat in particular for an operation at below 10~K.
% when it operates at below 10~K.
%We have focused on two types of measurements.
We estimate the heat dissipation from friction of the SMB by conducting the spin down measurements and we projected the heat dissipation of $2\sim20$~mW from the hysteresis contribution depending on the levitation height.
We discuss the consistency of the spin down measurements to the Bean's model between the magnetic field inhomogeneity and the hysteresis loss.
We also discuss the potential temperature rise of the rotor magnet when it is levitating at the temperature at around 10~K.
Thus, we address the means to estimate the rotor temperature by the physical contact to the rotor.
%We also characterize the thermal characteristics of the holder mechanism for the SMB system at below 10~K.
%We measure the thermal conductance of a grip holder, which is the thermal path when the rotor is held in place at the time of field cooling.
%The effective thermal conductance is 1~mW/K without any extra-effort to polish nor gold plate the contacted surface.
%We also implement a technique to estimate a levitating rotor temperature by using a thermal conductance of a gripper contact.
%The gripper thermometer follows a temperature of the rotor.
The extrapolated temperature recovers the rotor temperature with the difference of less than 2~K without any correction.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{A}{} cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is a relic radiation from the big bang.
We can measure this radiation today as an oldest light from the universe.
One of the fundamental questions in cosmology is to probe the presence of cosmic inflation just after the beginning of the universe \cite{inflation_sato,inflation_guth}.
Although such this event is predicted to correspond at as early as $\sim10^{-38}$ seconds after the beginning of the universe, the theory of inflation predicts the existence of the divergence free pattern in the CMB polarization, called B-mode.
The world-wide effort to hunt this signal is in progress from ground, balloon, and space-borne telescopes, and the corresponding instrumental development is ongoing.

One of the key instruments for this measurement is to use a polarization modulator \cite{abs,pb2,spider,shaul}.
It consists of an optical element, a half-wave plate (HWP), that rotates at a few Hz at the cryogenic temperature.
Due to its faint CMB signal, the HWP has to be maintained below about 10~K in order to minimize its own thermal emission.
As a result, this system requires to achieve the continuous rotation at about 10~K or below.
The standard mechanical bearing dissipates too much heat, and thus it is important to employ the rotational mechanism that allows to rotate with minimal heat dissipation at the cryogenic temperature.

A superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB) is a contactless bearing, and thus it achieves a continuous rotation at cryogenic temperature environment with minimal energy loss from friction \cite{hull_review}.
This technology is particularly attractive for various applications, including flywheel energy storage and high efficiency motor bearings.
A polarization modulator for a CMB polarization experiment is one of the applications which an SMB can play a key role to enable the continuous rotation at below 10~K environment.
In the past, EBEX, a balloon-borne CMB experiment, employs an SMB system for the polarization modulator \cite{jklein}, and there is an increasing interest to apply this technology to a ground telescope and even to a satellite mission \cite{litebird}.

The contactless bearing, like SMB, can achieve very low deceleration but friction is not zero.
This is due to the magnetic interaction between a rotor and a stator.
Previously we have conducted an experiment to estimate the energy loss using a prototype SMB model (diameter of 65~mm).
The estimated energy loss was measured as $19~\mu$W at 1~Hz under the vacuum environment below 10~K \cite{matsumura_eucas2015}.

In this paper we address estimating the heat dissipation of the 400~mm diameter SMB.
This diameter corresponds to the typical opening diameter in a CMB telescope optical chain.
Due to its diameter, it is difficult to construct a single ring magnet.
Thus, such a ring shape rotor magnet has to be composed as an array of segmented magnets and it forms a ring shape.
The spatial gap between the segmented magnets results undesired inhomogeneity of the magnetic field along the circumference of the ring shape rotor magnet.
In order to assess the energy loss during the rotation of the SMB due the magnetic field inhomogeneity from the gaps, we have conducted a spin down measurement at room pressure using liquid nitrogen.
We also discuss the interpretation of the energy loss and relates to the magnetic field inhomogeneity by using the Bean's model.
The energy loss eventually becomes heat.
%Given the fact that the bearing system is based on the levitation, the rotor can warm up due to the heat injection and this effect can be a significant at the cryogenic temperature.
A part of the heat goes to the rotor and the rotor can warm up.
This effect can be negligible when the rotor is operating at the room temperature. But the effect can be significant when the rotor is operating at below 10~K in vacuum due to no conductive nor convective heat path.
In order to assess such an effect, we discuss the method to estimate the rotor temperature at the cryogenic temperature.

%Secondly, the energy loss from the non-zero friction will eventually become heat.
%A part of the heat goes to the stator and the rest goes to the rotor.
%Since the rotor of SMB does not have any physical contact once levitates, there is no direct access to measure the rotor temperature.
%We implement the technique that is introduced by Klein et al. to estimate the rotor temperature and we demonstrate its functionality \cite{jklein}.

%In this paper, we address the heat dissipation and the temperature estimation of the rotor magnet experimentally using the two experimental configurations.
%First we describe the spin down measurements that is conducted at the room pressure using the liquid nitrogen.
%Second we describe the demonstration of the technique to estimate to the rotor temperature.
%Finally we discuss our results and further challenges to be addressed.

\section{Spin down measurements}
We conducted the spin down measurements using a Styrofoam bucket with liquid nitrogen as shown in the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:spindown}.
A large cryostat to encase the entire 400~mm SMB system is in preparation, and thus the evaluation in vacuum and below liquid nitrogen temperature will be addressed in the future studies.

We prepare an SMB system that has an opening diameter of 384~mm.
The ring magnet consists of 16 segmented NdFeB magnets that is magnetized axially with the magnetic remnance of 1.24~T.
The HTS array is formed in a ring shape using three-seeded YBCO tiles.
Both the ring magnet and the HTS tiles are fabricated by ATZ~\cite{atz}.

Only the array of YBCO is submerged by the liquid nitrogen and the rotor is exposed to the room pressure environment.
We measure the spin down rate with the two different levitation heights (3~mm and 6~mm).
The levitation height is defined as the gap between the bottom of the rotor and the top of the HTS.
The rotational frequency is monitored by using an optical chopper directly mounted on the rotor and an optical encoder, LED and Silicon photo-diode.
We also mount a Hall sensor at the gap between the rotor magnet and the HTS tiles.
Thus, we monitor the magnetic field as the rotor magnet rotates during the spin down.
We spin the rotor magnet to above 1~Hz by hand and let it spin down as we measure the spin rate.

Figure~\ref{fig:spindown} shows the rotational frequency as a function of time.
The rotor freely spins down at the levitation height of 6~mm.
We model this spin down profile with the following deceleration parameter, $\alpha$, as
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha = 2\pi \frac{df}{dt} = a_0 + 2\pi a_1 f,
\label{eq:spindown}
\end{eqnarray}
where $f$ is the rotational frequency\cite{hull_review}.
We consider three main causes of the deceleration: the hysteresis loss in the superconductor, the eddy current loss at the magnet holder, and the air friction.
%The first term, $a_0$, is constant regardless of $f$, while The second term, $a_1$, is belong it.
The hysteresis loss is represented by the $a_0$ term, and the eddy current loss and the air friction are represented by the $a_1$ term.

\section{Discussions}

\subsection{Source of friction}
We discuss the source of friction quantitatively.
As discussed in the previous section, we model the sources of friction in three contributors, hysteresis loss, eddy current loss and air friction.
Both the eddy current loss and the air friction have a rotational frequency dependency, and thus they degenerate.
Thus we focus on the contribution from the hysteresis.

Figure~\ref{fig:Bval} shows the magnetic field variation as a function of time during the spin down measurement.
The magnetic field inhomogeneity is originated due to the two reasons.
% the gap between the segments and the inhomogeneity of each segment magnet itself.
The spiky features correspond to the magnetic field variation due to the gap between the segments.
The number of the spike matches the number of the magnet segment that consists of a ring magnet.
The oscillatory features between the spikes are from the inhomogeneity of each segment magnet itself.
We parameterize the magnetic field inhomogeneity by taking the difference between the maximum and the minimum values within one period of revolution.

According to the Bean's model \cite{beans_model_1,beans_model_2}, the energy loss, $\Delta E$, due to the hysteresis is modelled as
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta E \propto \frac{(\Delta B)^3}{J_c}
\label{eq:bean}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta B$ is the difference of the magnetic field between the maximum and the minimum within one period of revolution and $J_c$ is the critical current of YBCO.

%We compare the fitted $a_0$ and $\sigma_B$.
%We form the ratio as
While it is beyond the scope of this paper to directly estimate the energy loss given the magnetic field inhomogeneity and the critical current, we can cross check the proportionality between the energy loss and the magnetic field inhomogeneity using the spin down measurements at the two different levitation heights, $h=3, 6$~mm.
The fitted $a_0$ and $\Delta B$ are compared by taking the ratio and it results as
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{a_0(h=6\mbox{mm})}{a_0(h=3\mbox{mm})} / \frac{\Delta B^3(h=6\mbox{mm})}{\Delta B^3(h=3\mbox{mm})} = 1.1.
\label{eq:beanmodelcheck}
\end{eqnarray}
In this comparison, we assume the $J_c$ is a constant value regardless of the levitation height.
The relationship between $a_0$ and $\Delta B$ is consistent with the prediction from the Bean's model.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Heat dissipation}

We estimate the heat dissipation from the result of the spin down measurements.
We assume all the energy loss during the spin down is eventually converted to heat.
Given the fitted parameters, we project the heat dissipation, $P_{h}$.
The power dissipation is expressed as
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{h} = \tau \omega = I \alpha \omega,
\label{eq:energyloss}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\tau$ is the torque of the rotor, and $\omega$ is the angular speed.
The angular speed is set as $\omega = 2 \pi\cdot 1$~Hz which is the target value of continuous rotation used in the polarization modulator.
The parameter, $\alpha$, is the deceleration as shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:spindown}.
The parameter, $I$, is the inertia of the rotor as
\begin{eqnarray}
I = \frac{1}{2}m (R_{in}^{2}+R_{out}^{2}),
\label{eq:inertia}
\end{eqnarray}
where $m$ is the weight of the rotor as $m=3~\mathrm{kg}$, and $R_{in}$ is the inner diameter of the rotor, $384$~mm and $R_{out}$ is the outer diameter of the rotor, $452$~mm.

In our estimation, we account the contribution only from the $a_0$ term, i.e. setting $a_1=0$.
This is because our interest is to cryogenically cool the entire SMB, and thus the rotor spins in vacuum.
The $a_1$ term from the current spin down measurement is believed to be dominated by the air friction.

The expected power dissipation due to friction only from the $a_0$ term contribution is 1.7~mW at the levitation height of 6~mm.
The further suppression of this power dissipation can be expected by minimizing the magnetic field inhomogeneity of the rotor magnet.
We are currently addressing this design optimization and will report in the future paper.
By neglecting the $a_1$ term, we may be underestimating the potential contribution to friction due to the eddy current.
We expect to be able to suppress the eddy current contribution by designing the SMB system with use of non-metallic material or slotted metal in surrounding structures.
The actual demonstration is yet to be done in the future study.

\subsection{Estimating the rotor temperature}
The energy loss due to friction will be eventually dissipated as heat.
A part of the heat goes to the rotor and the rest goes to the stator.
For an application which the SMB is cooled below 10~K, it is of great interest to estimate the rotor temperature.
Once the rotor is levitated, no conductive nor convective heat path to maintain the rotor temperature given the heat input.
Estimating the temperature of the levitating rotor using a remote sensing technology is challenging at the temperature below 10~K.
Thus, we discuss the method to estimate the rotor temperature after the spin down measurement at the cryogenic temperature.
%When a rotor is levitating, it is difficult to estimate its temperature remotely at the temperature below 10~K.

In order to demonstrate this estimation we use the previously constructed scaled prototype SMB model.
%\subsubsection{Thermal characterization of the rotor temperature}
%A scaled prototype SMB system is constructed.
The detailed description of this prototype system is in Matsumura et al.~\cite{matsumura_eucas2015}.
%This system is a scaled model of the SMB system that is described in the previous section, and the opening diameter of the rotor is 65~mm.
The cross sectional view is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figureA}.
This entire system is enclosed in a GM cryostat and is cooled down to the lowest temperature of about 6~K.
The cooling sequence is following.
The rotor magnet is held by three grippers when the SMB is cooled from the room temperature to about 6~K.
The YBCO array is field-cooled by the magnetic field of the rotor.
Once the rotor is thermalized by conduction through the three gripper arms, the rotor is released by actuating the gripper using a cryogenic stepping motor and it levitates.
We mount temperature sensors and a thin film resistive heater on the rotor.
We apply heat on the rotor after the levitation and raise the rotor temperature.
Once the rotor temperature is stabilized, the rotor is re-grabbed by the gripper and monitor the temperature rise of the gripper temperature.

Figure~\ref{fig:TemperatureEstimate} shows the temperature profile as a function of time.
The gripper temperature spikes up when the gripper makes a contact to the rotor.
Then, the rotor temperature starts decreasing together with the gripper temperature once the gripper temperature reaches to maximum.
We fit the gripper temperature data with two functional forms, linear and exponential.
When the temperature difference between the stator and the levitating rotor is small, the exponential form fits well.
On the other hand, the temperature difference is large, the linear function fits better.
For the linear fit, we select the gripper temperature data between $T_g^{max}$ and$(T_g^{max}+T_g^{min})/2$,
where $T_g^{max}$ and $T_g^{min}$ are the maximum and the minimum temperature of the gripper in this profile.
%The reason why we choose the two functional forms are followings.
%If the specific heat and the thermal conductivity of the gripper and the rotor are constant with a temperature, the temperature profile in Figure~\ref{fig:TemperatureEstimate} is expected to be an exponential functional form.
%As the temperature change is significant enough to take into account the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity and the specific heat, the temperature profile is expected to be linear.
The extrapolated temperature from the fit at the time of the gripping shows the lower temperature than the actual rotor temperature by less than 2~K, even if we use either of the fit functions.

The thermal conductance between the stator and the rotor during the cool down process is purely limited by the physical contact of the holder mechanism.
%The three grippers are placed in 120 degrees apart as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figureA}.
Each gripper has a wedge shape that moves radially and mate with the rotor that also has an identical but negative wedge shape.
%The gripper is actuated by a cryogenic stepping motor.
%We mounted a temperature sensor on the gripper arm.
%We also placed three heaters, thin-film resistors, on the rotor.
%The thermal conductance via wires for the thermometers and heaters are estimated as less than 6~$\mu$W.
We measure the temperature difference between the rotor and the gripper arm.
Figure~\ref{fig:thermalcond} shows the linear relationship between the applied electrical heat and the temperature difference between the rotor and the gripper arm.
We derive the effective thermal resistance between the two temperature sensors, including two metal surfaces, from the slope.
The thermal resistance is $10^{3}$~K/W, and the corresponding effective thermal conductance is $1$~mW/K.
The gripper arm and the rotor holder is made of aluminum.
The surfaces of the gripper and the rotor are not polished nor gold plated, and thus there is a room for improvement.
%While we can increase the pressure between the two surfaces by applying more torque to the gripper against to the rotor we did not pursue this in order to mitigate the actuator to be stacked by applying too much torque.

%The three thin-film resistors (heater) and the three temperature sensor (Cernox) are mounted on the rotor. The resistive power is applied when the rotor magnet is held by the three grippers and we estimate the thermal conductance through the physical contact of the holder mechanism.
%Once the rotor is levitating, the rotor temperature is difficult to estimate. We develop the calibration scheme to estimate the rotor temperature by using a thermometer mounted at the gripper arm.

%When a rotor is levitating, it is difficult to estimate its temperature remotely.
%We conduct an experiment to estimate the rotor temperature by monitoring the temperature on the gripper arm at the moment of grabbing the rotor.
%The sequence of the experiment is following.
%The three grippers hold the rotor until the rotor is thermalized.
%%Once the rotor is thermalized,
%Then, the rotor is released from the three grippers and thus the rotor levitates.
%We apply the electrical power to the rotor heater.
%The rotor temperature increases due to no thermal pass except the radiation and resistive wires.
%Once the temperature of the rotor increases to about 10~K, the rotor is grabbed using the grippers.
%%we grip the rotor using the three grippers.
%We monitor the temperature rise of the three temperature sensors mounted on each gripper arm.
%

%where $T_g^{max}$ and $T_g^{min}$ are the maximum and the minimum temperature of the gripper in this profile.
%
%The reason why we choose the two functional forms are followings.
%If the specific heat and the thermal conductivity of the gripper and the rotor are constant with a temperature, the temperature profile in Figure~\ref{fig:TemperatureEstimate} is expected to be an exponential functional form.

%%The temperature decreasing is expected to depend on the specific heat and the thermal conductivity of the gripper arm and the rotor holder.
%%The specific heat and the thermal conductivity are possible to vary with temperature and the pressure between two surfaces of the gripper and the rotor holder.
%
%The extrapolated temperature from the fit at the time of the gripping shows the lower temperature than the actual rotor temperature by less than 2~K, even if we use either of the fit functions.

\section{Conclusion}
We have conducted the spin down measurements to estimate the heat dissipation from friction of the SMB when the rotor is the diameter of D=384~mm and is constructed by the segmented magnets.
From this measurement, the expected heat dissipation from the hysteresis is in the order of mW.
The further effort of minimizing the magnetic field inhomogeneity can potentially reduce the energy loss.

We also discuss the potential impact of this heat loss to the rotor temperature when it is used at the cryogenic temperature.
We estimate the levitating rotor temperature by extrapolating the gripper temperature after the mechanical contact, and we conclude that we can project the rotor temperature of less than 2~K without introducing any correction method.
%Second, we have conducted the thermal conductance measurements of the holder mechanism in order to facilitate the technique to understand the thermal performance of the SMB at below 10~K.
%We measure the 1 mW/K of thermal conductance.
%This work is a part of the programs to develop the polarization modulator using SMB for a CMB polarization experiment including the satellite platform.
